This is a school project.

## Installation

First, you can clone the project :

```
git clone https://github.com/RolletQuentin/ultimate-tic-tac-toe
cd ultimate-tic-tac-toe
```

Then you have to activate an Python environment (optionnal) and install the requirements :

```

source .venv/bin/activate
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
